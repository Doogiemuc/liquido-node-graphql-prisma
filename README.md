# Liquido GraphQL Server implemented in node

This is a re-implementation of my existing LIQUIDO server that was written in JAVA with spring-boot.
The node implementation is much smaller, more lightweight and ... hopefully ... can be hosted somewhere for free :-)

Based on the wunderfull example boilerplate code of Prisma: https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples
